* About this Project

Easily embed any game in a browser or client, with some wrappers for showing saved states during this session and other cool stuff.

* Dependencies

This project packages Retroarch (and maybe soon v86) for web-embedding and for desktop distribution through Tauri.  Right now, we're focusing on Retroarch; so from time to time (and before the first time), it's a good idea to run =./dist-update.sh= to get the latest Retroarch web and native builds.

* Dead-simple embedding page

=simple/= has an example of a pure JavaScript web-based embedding of Retroarch in a handful of files.  Here's how to get going:

1. Copy a ROM and optionally save state (a file called =entry_state=) and BSV input recording (=movie.bsv=) into =simple/content/=, then modify =simple/libretro_embed.js= with the name of the ROM and core.
2. Execute =./run.sh= to copy these to the =retroarch-web/= folder and starts a Python http server.
3. Hit up =localhost:8080/embed_one.html= to play a game.
